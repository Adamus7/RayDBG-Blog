I always like to practice coding skills and algorithm on [LeetCode](leetcode.com). Since I'm not a genius who can write code on white paper and debug the code on the air, a local test before submitting the code is really important to me. So, everytime, I need to read the descriptions of the problem on LeetCode, create a local project with a main function, implement a class with functions for the problem, create test inputs and check the output manually. It is terrible because I have to repeat those steps every time. In this article, I would like to introduce how I solved the above problem with .NET Core, XUnit and PowerShell Scripts.

# Get the problem from LeetCode
[Haoel](https://github.com/haoel/leetcode) shared a batch script on GitHub which can retrieve description of a problem from LeetCode and help to generate corresponding C++ class file with comments. [Codeyu](https://github.com/codeyu/LeetCode/tree/master/Scripts) forked it and reimpelemented it for .NET with PowerShell. What's more, in Codeyu's script, a test class for XUnit will be generated together! It is easy to use, run PowerShell command as:
{% codeblock lang:powershell %}
PS /Users/github/MyLeetCode> ./auto.ps1 https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/
{% endcodeblock %}
The NextPermutation.cs and NextPermutationTest.cs files would be generated by above command.
