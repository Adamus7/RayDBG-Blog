HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP which allowing all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS offers an extra layer of security because it uses SSL to transfer data. Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Edge and Chrome will display a **padlock** icon in the address bar to visually indicate that a HTTPS connection is in effect.
However, the process of acquiring an TLS/SSL certification and enable HTTPS protocol has never been easy. You have to pay extra money for a certificates every year and deal with a lot of detail settings. **Let's Encrypt**, a new certificate authority, provide a simple and free process of manual certificate creation, validation, singing, installation and renewal. Please note, the free Let's Encrypt certificate will be expired in 3 months, which means you need a process to periodically renew the certificate if you choose it. In this blog, I would like to document how I apply HTTPS on my Azure Web App with Let's Encrypt and enable auto certificate renewal.

# The Story
[Add support for free SSL certs like those from Let's Encrypt](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169385-web-apps-formerly-websites/suggestions/6737285-add-support-for-free-ssl-certs-like-those-from-let) is a high votes feature on Azure Web App for a long time. It is resolved by community that Simon published a Azure Site extension, [Azure Let's Encrypt](http://www.siteextensions.net/packages/letsencrypt), for easy install and renewals of Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.

# Prerequisites
* Make sure that you Scale Up your App Service Plan allows SNI (Server Name Indication) and Custom Domains / SSL
{% asset_img 01.png %}
* A custom domain name.

# Setup

## Configure Azure Web Jobs Connection string
Azure Let's Encrypt extension requires a web job to renew the certificate once it expires every 3 months. Therefore, you need to add the two Connection strings `AzureWebJobsDashboard` and `AzureWebJobsStorage` to your Azure Web App.
Both of these should be set to an Azure Storage Account connection string, e.g. `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=[myaccount];AccountKey=[mykey]`; Be sure that the connection string doesn't end with `EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net` as the extension will not work then.

## Configure Service Principal for Azure Let's Encrypt extension
Service Principal is Azure AD concept which just like a service account that allow specific application to access your Azure resources. Our extension need a service principal to get the permission to access the resources to renew and install the certificate.
### Create a Service Principal though the portal
Login to Azure Portal
Navigate to `Azure Active Directory` -> `App Registrations`, click `New application registration`
{% asset_img 03.png %}
Fill in name of the application and select `WEB APP/API` and click the next button. For `SIGN-ON URL`, provide the URI to a web-site that describes your application. The existence of the website is not validated. You can use the url to the web app you want SSL on.
Click Create
    {% asset_img 04.png %}
### Get the Application ID and create a secret
The service principal is uniquely identified by its `Application ID`. To get that, select the newly created application.
You should see the `Application ID` in details page. Then click on `Keys` in settings page.
{% asset_img 05.png %}
Create a new Password (secret key). Copy the key value.
{% asset_img 06.png %}

So now you should have 
*   `Application ID`
*   `Secret Key`

### Grant permission to the Service Principal
Navigate to your resource group for you App Service and App Service Plan
Click the `Access control(IAM)` -> `Add`
{% asset_img 07.png %}
Add `Contributor` role to your Service Principal

## Setup Let's Encrypt
Now let's install and configure Let's Encrypt extension and  

### Install Let's Encrypt extension
Open your site's SCM page (`https://{your site name}.scm.azurewebsites.net`).
In Site extension page, search Azure Let's Encrypt. Click `+` to install it for your application.
Once the site extension has finished installing, you'll be required to restart the site. After the restart, click the triangle Launch button that replaced the extension's install button.

### Configure Azure Let's Encrypt
The first page of the site contains the following fields that must be provided by you. You can either fill them out from the site extension or you can set the properties as app settings. 
>   `Tenant` - is the tenant name of the Azure AD that the service principal was created in, e.g. yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com
>   `SubscriptionId` - is the subscription id that the resource groups belongs to. You get the ID from https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade
>   `ClientId` - is the client id of the application/service principal you created
>   `ClientSecret` - is the password/key you created for the service principal
>   `ResourceGroupName` - is the name of the resource group that the App Service is located in 
>   `ServicePlanResourceGroupName` - is the name of the resource group that the App Service Plan is located in, e.i. if you are hosting everything in the same resource group ServicePlanResourceGroupName should equal ResourceGroupName
>   `Update Application Settings` - set this to true to save the setting as web application settings, this is required if you didn't already add the settings as web app settings, so the values are available for the renew certificate web job later.

### Verify Hostnames
Before you can request a Let's Encrypt certificate for the web app, you need to register a custom domain name. Once a domain name is registered you should see something similar to this:
    {% asset_img 11.png %}
### Request and Install certificate
Click `Next` on previous page to proceed the process to request the certificate.
Select which hostname you want to request certificates for and provide your email address.
Click Request and install certificates.
    {% asset_img 12.png %}
Wait a little, while the certificate gets requested and installed and assigned to your domain.

# Done!
Now, let's access our website using HTTPS protocol, you should able to it is marked as secure by browsers. More important, the certificate will be auto renewed when is expired!

    {% asset_img 14.png Chrome%}

# One more step
Wait! Don't forget to redirect HTTP request to HTTPS!
You can do it in many ways. I just added a redirect rule in web.config as below
    {% codeblock lang:xml %}
    <configuration xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/.NetConfiguration/v2.0">
        <system.webServer>    
            <rewrite>
                <rules>
	    	<rule name="HTTP to HTTPS redirect" stopProcessing="true">
	    	        <match url="(.*)" />
	    		<conditions>
	    		  <add input="{HTTPS}" pattern="off" ignoreCase="true" />
	    		</conditions>
	    	  <action type="Redirect" redirectType="Found" url="https://{HTTP_HOST}/{R:1}" />
	    	</rule>
                </rules>
            </rewrite>
    </system.webServer>
    </configuration>
    {% endcodeblock %}
