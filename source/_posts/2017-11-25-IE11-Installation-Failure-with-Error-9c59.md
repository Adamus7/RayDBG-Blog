In this blog, I will document how to solve a typical scenario of IE 11 install/upgrade failure.
<!-- more -->
# Background
Since IE 11 is the only supported IE version on Win 7 SP1 and Win Server 2008 R2 currently, you have to update IE to latest version to get security and feature updates. However, IE is not a standalone application which can be installed, uninstalled or upgraded easily.
You might already have the [official IE 11 installation package](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads), but sometime the installation just failed as below:

# Logs
There are some logs can help you to dig into this error:
*   %windir%\IE11_main.log
*   %windir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log
*   %windir%\Logs\DISM\DISM.log

# A typical failure with error code 9c59 in IE11_main.log
Probably 50% of IE 11 installation failure will see a similar pattern below in IE11_mail.log:
{% codeblock %}

Then you might see a similar error pattern in CBS.log as below:

{% endcodeblock %}
The installation failed start at
Exec: Staging Package: Package_3_for_KB2706045~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0.
That means one package of KB2706045 is corrupted for some reasons.

## Solution
As the installation failed because of a outdated and corrupted package, we can try to remove that package by DISM command first.
1.  Run below command to get the package full name :
    ```
    > dism /online /get-packages |findstr KB2706045
    Package Identity : Package_3_for_KB2706045~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0
    Package Identity : Package_for_KB2706045_SP1~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0
    Package Identity : Package_for_KB2706045~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0
    ```
2.  Then use DISM command to remove that top level package:
    ```
    > dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_KB2706045~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0
    Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
    Version: 6.1.7600.16385
 
    Image Version: 6.1.7600.16385
 
    Processing 1 of 1 - Removing package Package_for_KB2706045~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0
    [==========================100.0%==========================]
    The operation completed successfully.

    ```
3.  If the above action finished with no error, please try to reinstall IE 11 again.
**Note**: It might fail again because there might be multiple corrupted files. If this happens, please redo the procedure for any additional package you might have according the CBS.log. Usually we saw there are 2-3 Packages corrupted. 

# More words
If you need an offline IE 11 full installation package, please follow Joji's steps:
*   [Create Internet Explorer 11 batch deployment package](http://joji.me/en-us/blog/create-internet-explorer-11-batch-deployment-package)

Also you can use [Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/bb219517.aspx) to customize IE 11 installation.
