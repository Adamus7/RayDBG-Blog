Several years ago when I was in college, I used Matlab to study Machine Learning. I just would like to pick up Deep Learning again to catch up the AI trend. The first step is to set up the tools and environment. In this post I will share how to set up my Deep Learning environment with Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook, and then install TensorFlow.

# Why choose Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda
Jupyter Notebook is not a pre-requisite for Deep Learning, but it is really helpful to create rich documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text for your experiment. It is just like a white broad where you can put your idea on and continuously evolve the project code.
Anaconda a platform which can help you to create virtual environments and install packages needed for data science and deep learning. As you may know, version conflict is quite normal in Python/DL world because different Deep Learning frameworks may require different projects or packages. I tried with native Python and pip environment before, but it is really a nightmare for me. With virtual environments I can install specific package versions for a particular project or a tutorial without worrying about the annoying version conflicts.

## Install and Setup the Environment in Anaconda
Download Anaconda for your platform from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
Install it.
